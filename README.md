# Git Cheatsheet

Well, this is called a cheatsheet, but it's also a teaching aid. If you just need a reference, check the `reference` directory. If you want more detailed instruction on how Git works, check the `instruction` directory. Also there's a makefile to convert one of the versions to PDF, if you're on unix and happen to have the right software.
